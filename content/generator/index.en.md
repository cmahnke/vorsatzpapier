On this page, the endpapers and wallpapers can be arranged into large-scale patterns to be used as screen backgrounds, for example.

{{< lucienne src=/patterns/collection.json urlinput=false resize=true download=true >}}

The software is called Lucienne and is intended to commemorate the designer [Lucienne Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucienne_Day), who also became famous for her textile and wallpaper designs of the 50s and 60s. More in [this blog post](https://christianmahnke.de/en/post/wallpaper-generator).
