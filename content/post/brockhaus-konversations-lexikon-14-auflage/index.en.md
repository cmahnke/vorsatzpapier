# About the work

These sheets are from Brockhaus' Konversations-Lexikon, 14. edition, published 1892-1895 by Brockhaus Verlag, Leipzig.
Since only these have survived, it is not entirely clear which [variant of the 14th edition](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Ausgabe_des_Brockhaus-Konversationslexikons) it is.
