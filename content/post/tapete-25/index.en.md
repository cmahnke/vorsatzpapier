A somewhat uneasy wallpaper from the 50s...<!--more-->
... recognisable by the fact that it has a border that has to be cut off before application...

<div class="source">
I've purchased it from the best supplier of historical wallpapers in GÃ¶ttingen - <a target="_blank" href="http://zeitzeug.de/">Zeitzeug</a>.
